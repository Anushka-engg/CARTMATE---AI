# 🛒 CARTMATE-AI – AI Cart Recovery Agent

🚀 Built as part of the **Swafinix AI Agents Hackathon 2025**

 <p><strong>Theme:</strong> E-commerce – AI Cart Recovery Agent</p>
  <p><strong>Function:</strong> AI-powered voice + Email agent that identifies users who abandoned carts and engages them via messages to recover sales.</p>

  **Problem Statement**
"Millions of shopping carts are abandoned daily, leading to lost revenue. Manually following up with these customers is slow and inefficient.
CartMate AI solves this by automating the recovery process using conversational AI agents that contact users through voice calls and personalized emails."
